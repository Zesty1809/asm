# Mastering study resources

1. Follow the "Read -> Code -> Repeat" Cycle
  1. Read the book/watch the lecture.
  2. Code the examples manually (don't copy paste).
  3. Build a small project or solve exercises related to that topic.
  4. Document your learnings (use note templates).

2. Sequence for Beginners (Months 1-6)

## Phase 1: Python + Math Basics
  - Books:
    1. Python Crash Course -> Focus on Ch. 1-10 (skip Django/Web Dev).
    2. Mathematics for Machine Learning -> Ch. 1-4 (Linear Algebra, Calculus)

# Weekly Schedule
